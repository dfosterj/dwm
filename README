# dedwm - A minimal dwm fork

This is a personal fork of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) - a dynamic window manager for X. This fork keeps dwm as small as possible while including only the patches and customizations that fit my specific needs.

## Features

This fork includes the following patches:
- **attachaside** - New windows attach at the side of the focused window
- **movestack** - Move clients up/down in the stack (Mod+Shift+j/k)
- **systray** - System tray support in the status bar
- **uselessgap** - Simple gaps between windows (6px by default)
- **autodarkmode** - Automatic dark/light mode switching based on `~/.lightmode` file
- **restartsig** - Restart dwm with signals or Mod+Ctrl+Shift+q

## Customizations

- **Modkey**: Uses Mod4Mask (Windows/Meta key) instead of Mod1Mask (Alt)
- **Terminal**: Uses `st` as the default terminal
- **Keybindings**:
  - `Mod+d` - Launch dmenu (appears at bottom of screen)
  - `Mod+Return` - Launch terminal
  - `Mod+Shift+Escape` - Quit dwm
  - `Mod+Ctrl+Shift+q` - Restart dwm
  - `Mod+-` / `Mod+=` - Volume down/up
  - `Mod+m` - Toggle mute
  - `Mod+w` - Toggle WiFi
  - `Mod+Shift+j/k` - Move windows up/down in stack
- **Gaps**: Simple 6px gaps between windows (configurable via `gappx` in `config.def.h`)
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatically switches based on presence of `~/.lightmode` file. Send SIGHUP to dwm to refresh mode.

## Requirements

### Build Dependencies
- Xlib header files
- Xft library
- A C compiler (gcc/clang)

### Runtime Dependencies
- **st** - Simple terminal (or modify `config.def.h` to use your preferred terminal)
- **dmenu** - Application launcher (appears at bottom of screen)
- **pactl** (PulseAudio) - For volume control (optional, for volume keybindings)
- **nmcli** (NetworkManager) - For WiFi toggle (optional, for WiFi keybinding)

## Installation

1. Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (defaults to `/usr/local`)
   - On macOS, you may need to adjust `X11INC` and `X11LIB` paths
   - Example for macOS with XQuartz: `X11INC = /opt/X11/include` and `X11LIB = /opt/X11/lib`

2. Build and install:
   ```bash
   make clean install
   ```
   
   Note: `config.h` is automatically generated from `config.def.h` by the Makefile. If you encounter compilation errors about missing variables or functions, run `make clean` to force regeneration.

3. Add to your `.xinitrc`:
   ```bash
   exec dwm
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is done by editing `config.def.h` and recompiling:

```bash
# Edit config.def.h
vim config.def.h

# Rebuild
make clean install
```

## Dependencies and Apps Used

### Core Applications
- **dwm** - Window manager (this fork)
- **st** - Terminal emulator
- **dmenu** - Application launcher

### System Integration
- **PulseAudio** (`pactl`) - Audio system for volume control
- **NetworkManager** (`nmcli`) - Network management (for WiFi toggle)

### Optional Tools
- **feh** - Image viewer/wallpaper setter (preferred)
- **nitrogen** - Alternative wallpaper setter
- **xwallpaper** - Alternative wallpaper setter

### Dark/Light Mode
dwm automatically switches between dark and light color schemes based on the presence of `~/.lightmode`:
- If `~/.lightmode` exists: uses light color scheme
- If `~/.lightmode` doesn't exist: uses dark color scheme (default)
- To switch modes: create/remove `~/.lightmode` and send SIGHUP to dwm: `pkill -SIGHUP dwm`
- Can be integrated with tools like `darkman` or `Redshift` for automatic switching

### Gaps
Simple gaps between windows (6px by default, configurable via `gappx` in `config.def.h`):
- Gaps are automatically removed in monocle layout or when only one window is visible
- Gaps are applied in tiled layouts when multiple windows are present
